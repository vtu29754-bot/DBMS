        "Specialization\n",
        "In the context of Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, specialization refers to the process of defining subtypes within an entity type.

        "\n",
        "Check constraint to enforce the domain:\n",
        "To enforce the domain on the \"age\" attribute and ensure that only valid values are allowed, we can create a check constraint in the database schema. The check constraint will specify the condition that the \"age\" attribute must satisfy.\n",
